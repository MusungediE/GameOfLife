# GameOfLife

Requirements

You shall choose one team member as leader for purposes of coordinating the project and reporting to the instructor.�

 PowerPoint slide show MUST include the following:

�  User - statement of problem, and general requirements (inputs, outputs, etc.)

�  Design - Overview of solution, key design features, user interface, UML class diagrams, pseudo code etc.

�  Testing - (if applicable) how tested (e.g., test plan, data used, tracking and reporting bugs, bugs fixed/not fixed, etc.)


Grading

Meet the requirements (see the Requirements section above), you will receive credit Full credit will be based on group that used creativity and whom went above and beyond my requirements.

Your team must turn in the paper as specified above and do the presentations in order to get credit. It will not be sufficient to simply turn in the files to I-College and have it posted on codd. All members post the URL or Project to your student account.



The leader shall create a separate page that is linked in the PPT to list the roles it should state the following: �

�  Leader�s Name

�  Project Name

�  Description: a one-sentence description of your project

�  Roles: who did what

�  Methodology : << (see the included link) used and a quick summary of how it benefited you on this project

 

Topic - Conway's Game of Life

Implement the Game of Life using HTML/CSS, php, Java Script, along with any other libraries

 

PLAGIARISM DISCLAIMER

We are fully aware of many sources are available and we will check

Acknowledgement should always be made when secondary sources are used. Failure to acknowledge sources will be penalized and any substantial plagiarism � for example, unacknowledged quotation that extends for more than a few lines, or extended close paraphrasing of a critical work � will automatically be reported to the university disciplinary board and can lead to suspension.

 

 

Objective: The game of life is a grid of cells where each cell is in the state of being alive or not. The next generation of the game depends on the current generation and the following rules:

The game consists of a grid of cells, each of which can be alive or dead. For every cycle of the game, the cells can be turned on or off based on the following rules:

 

1.� Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, which is caused by under population. 

2.� Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding. 

3.� Any live cell with two or three live neighbors� lives on to the next generation. 

4.� Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.

5.� If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to

6. If a live cell has less than two live neighbors, it dies

7. If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies

8. If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it continues living. life - Therefore by repeating the cycle over and over, these simple rules create interesting, often unpredictable patterns.

Please select your members as normal contact me in advance if you have concerns

Design Specifications

1.�� Create a variable sized table. (Grads use DHTML) 

2.�� The background color of the cells will determine life.

3.�� The cells can be turned on or off with the mouse.

4.�� Display the current population (Grads only) and generation. 

5.�� Create a button for each of the following functions (using mouse events such as clicks, drags i.e.):

A.     Start the game

B.      Stop the game

C.      Increment 1 generation

D.     Increment 23 generations

E.      Reset the game (Population=0 or other, Generation=0).

F.      Pattern button/Drop down selection to (Animate selection)

G.     Create a login profile for each user using registration and auto link relocation to the sign-in. *Extra credit if you use some types of login authentication.

v  HTTP basic authentication.

v  Form-based login authentication.

v  Client certificate authentication.

v  Mutual authentication.

v  Digest authentication.

 

H.     Store the name of players in a file or array and keep track of any user events stats i.e., time and a score etc.

 

6.� Undergraduates (Please choose 3 patterns --- (1) pattern from the Still life and Two Oscillators, Gliders are welcome and will be considered as a Bonus)

7.�� Graduates only - Please create Random Populations (choose 1 pattern from the Still life (2) patterns Oscillators and (1) pattern Gliders).� Graduates only use any demo patterns that will demonstrate the following behavior: {Create any type of animated lit points that will turn off if there are fewer than two or more than three surrounding lit points. An unlit point turns on if there are exactly three lit neighbors}

**** Bonus Graduates**** Implement the use of the React.js develop a component that will display the beginning state of the GRID and Ending state of the GIRD (real-time update)
